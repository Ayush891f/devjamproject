            Food in IIITH is one of the best food among all the colleges in the country. We have 4 messes. You can eat anyone of them (no restrictions). Food in canteens is also good. We have 3 working canteens.So, in the college food will never be a problem for anyone whether you are from North or South India.    <section>
        <h3>academic reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Faculty members in our college are helpful to students in making them stronger and clever, and they never discourage us. They are well-educated, and almost half of the faculty members are from IITs of North India. They are knowledgeable, so they can easily make us brighter with their thoughts.The course curriculum is very well-designed by the institute. It is a research-based college. So, no industry exposure is provided, but you are a research student, you can have many advantages
