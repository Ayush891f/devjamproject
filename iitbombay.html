        <p>
            
            Mess food is good and also it depend on Hostel . MY Hostel is H16 . Hostel 16 mess is a Private mess. A decent amount of fruits are also part of our regular mess menu. Jain food is also provided in Lunch and Dinner . We have either Dawat or Tea party once in the month ( on that day there is half day Mesa because of pest control ) . There are separate counters for veg and Non veg .Non - veg is paid one . In order to take Non-veg , the required amount is deducted from Mess advanced. Items for breakfast: Idli , medu vada , aloo , paneer gobi paratha, Jam bread , Aloo puri , dosa , set dosa, poha , paneer bhurji ,milk , banana .( all these are repeated ) . In lunch we get two types of vegetables , chapati , Dal ,Rice , pickle , curd , butter milk , lassi etc . Snacks : Maggi , Frankie , veg cheese burger ,dahi vada , sev puri , pani puri , kachori chaat , dahi puri etc    </section>

        <h3>academic reviews</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing Btech in Computer Science and Engineering in IITB.I chose because firstly I have interest in computers and coding.Secondly it is the most demanded batch in the whole country. Every JEE qualified student in their first choice in JOSAA gives IITB CSE as the first choice.Yes the curriculum is updated and includes all the recent development.Yes the study is more than enough for getting a good job.
