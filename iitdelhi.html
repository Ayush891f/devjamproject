        <h3>mess food reviews</h3>
        <p>
            The mess food is average. The general trend in most hostels is Breakfast>>Lunch>=Dinner.
             The mess menu is decided upon for the entirety of the winter/summer semesters separately and
              generally doesn't change throughout the semester. For breakfast, we have bread, butter, jam and milk everyday, with the rest of the menu having eggs, cornflakes, idli/dosa, puri/aloo, sprouts
              , paratha, etc. (any two out of the rest on a given day) For lunch and dinner, we have roti, rice and one daal to choose from everyday.
              The sabzi varies, some are good and some you wouldn't like so much. 

            Every hostel’s mess has one day where they go all out and make something everyone craves, like chole bhature in my hostel. They are mostly seasonal and you will enjoy lunch on 2–3 days out of 7. Dinner is worse compared to lunch (at least for my hostel) because there’s a weird focus on paneer which everyone 
            got bored of within a few weeks. Some days have special drinks like aam panna, chaach, or even ice cream depending on what has been decided. 
            
            All in all, it doesn’t matter too much what you eat in the mess, because after a couple of months every other meal is either ordered online or from one of the other places to eat within campus. Don’t worry too much about the mess food if you plan to join, it will be the least of your concerns!
