        <h3>mess food reviews</h3>
        <p>
            
            By food at IIT Kanpur, I assume you are referring to the Mess Food. Quite frankly, I thought the food was not good enough until I visited two other IITs Bombay and Madras. I visited these other IITs in quick succession and realised that the food in Kanpur is much better for most days of the week than Bombay and Madras. No offences to the food in these IITs and to the people who like the food there. Also, I would add that it is ultimately your own preference which matters because I have seen people who criticize the mess food like anything and also those who praise it like anything. As far as IIT Kanpur is concerned, you will get food almost 24 hours a day except very early in the morning so there are numerous options to choose from before you have a meal at any time of the day        </p>
