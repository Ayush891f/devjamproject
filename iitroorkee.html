        <h3>Placement reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Placements is certainly good. In our time placements were generally in the traditional manufacturing sector as IT revolution had not taken place but with the IT revolution the sakary has gone through the roof.        </p>

        <h3>infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
            Roorkee has got the best infrastructure among all IIT'S. I have been to some other IIT like Powai and BHU but Roorkee wins it hands down. Well maintained Mess hostels labs and libraries. Food is the best .    </section>

        <h3>academic reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Acads wise Roorkee is quite good but it needs to update its curriculum in tune with Induztry 4.0. Though it is revising its syllabus but the change needs to be faster as the technology is changing overnight.
